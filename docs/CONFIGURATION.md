# Configuration

The dashboard can be customized through a combination of a `config.json` file and environment variables. Environment variables always override values found in the configuration file.

Profitability calculations are always performed in USD. When a non-USD currency is configured,
values are converted using the latest exchange rates before being displayed.
Earnings projections now rely on your 24-hour average hashrate rather than shorter intervals to
smooth volatility.

## `config.json`

The default configuration file contains the following keys:

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `power_cost` | Electricity cost per kWh | `0.0` |
| `power_usage` | Power usage in watts | `0.0` |
| `wallet` | Ocean.xyz wallet address | `"yourwallethere"` |
| `timezone` | Local timezone identifier | `"America/Los_Angeles"` |
| `network_fee` | Additional fees beyond pool fees | `0.0` |
| `currency` | Preferred fiat currency for earnings display | `"USD"` |
| `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` | ExchangeRate-API key for currency conversion | `""` |
| `extended_history` | Store one month of metrics history (requires Redis for persistence) | `false` |
| `low_hashrate_threshold_ths` | Threshold used by the notification service to determine low hashrate mode (TH/s). Does **not** affect the front-end chart. | `3.0` |
| `high_hashrate_threshold_ths` | Threshold above which normal hashrate mode resumes (TH/s) | `20.0` |

Configuration files are validated when loaded. Missing keys or incorrect types
cause the application to fall back to default values and log an error.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection URL for persistent state | None |
| `WALLET` | Ocean.xyz wallet address | from `config.json` |
| `POWER_COST` | Electricity cost per kWh | from `config.json` |
| `POWER_USAGE` | Power consumption in watts | from `config.json` |
| `NETWORK_FEE` | Additional fees beyond pool fees | from `config.json` |
| `TIMEZONE` | Local timezone identifier | from `config.json` |
| `CURRENCY` | Preferred fiat currency | from `config.json` |
| `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` | ExchangeRate-API key for currency rates | from `config.json` |
| `FLASK_ENV` | Application environment | `development` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `INFO` |
| `PORT` | Application port | `5000` |

Refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for instructions on how these variables are used during setup and deployment.

## Low Hashrate Mode

Low hashrate mode engages automatically when the 60â€‘second hashrate hovers near
zero. The logic is implemented in `static/js/main.js` and stores its state in
`localStorage` so the mode persists across reloads. The thresholds are hard
coded and not currently user configurable. See
[LOW-HASHRATE-MODE.md](LOW-HASHRATE-MODE.md) for details.

## Caching

Expensive operations such as network requests, complex calculations and Redis queries are cached to reduce
load on external services. Results are retained for up to 60 seconds before being refreshed. The built-in
cache requires no configuration. Caches use a time-to-live strategy and can be
manually purged by calling the ``purge_caches`` method on the dashboard service
or ``cache_purge`` on any ``ttl_cache`` decorated function.
