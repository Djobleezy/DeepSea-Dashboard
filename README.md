## Documentation

Comprehensive guides have been moved to the `docs` directory:

- [Installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md)
- [Deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Configuration options](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
- [Worker naming guide](docs/WORKER-NAMING.md)
- [Testing guide](docs/TESTING.md)
- [Keyboard shortcuts](docs/KEYBOARD-SHORTCUTS.md)

### Customization

You can modify the following environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
- `WALLET`: Your Bitcoin wallet address.
- `POWER_COST`: Cost of power per kWh.
- `POWER_USAGE`: Power usage in watts.
- `NETWORK_FEE`: Additional fees beyond pool fees (e.g., firmware fees).
- `TIMEZONE`: Local timezone for displaying time information.
- `CURRENCY`: Preferred fiat currency for earnings display.
- `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY`: ExchangeRate-API key used for fetching currency rates.
  Falls back to `config.json` if unset. Metrics requiring currency conversion
  will not work without a valid key.

Redis data is stored in a persistent volume (`redis_data`), and application logs
are saved in the `./logs` directory. Logs rotate automatically when they reach
5MB, with up to five backups kept.

For more details, refer to the [docker-compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Technical Architecture

Built with a modern stack for reliability and performance:
- **Backend**: Flask with Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js for visualization
- **Data Processing**: Concurrent API calls with smart caching
- **Resilience**: Automatic recovery mechanisms and state persistence
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and JSON-based settings

## Historical Data Retention

The dashboard stores a rolling window of historical metrics in memory. Each
dataset (arrow history, metrics log and hashrate history) is capped at 180
entries, equating to roughly three hours of data. Older points are pruned by the
`StateManager` before saving to Redis, ensuring memory usage remains stable.
Short-term variance history for earnings metrics is also persisted so 3-hour
variance values remain visible after restarts. Minor gaps of a few minutes are
filled automatically using the last known metric so the variance progress can
reach 100% even with occasional missing samples.

## Troubleshooting

For optimal performance:

1. Ensure your wallet address is correctly configured
2. Check network connectivity for consistent updates
3. Use the system monitor to verify connection status
4. Access the health endpoint at `/api/health` for diagnostics
5. For stale data issues, use the Force Refresh function
6. Use hotkey Shift+R to clear chart and Redis data (as needed, not required)
7. Check the currency settings if financial calculations appear incorrect
8. Verify timezone settings for accurate time displays
9. Alt + W on Dashboard resets wallet configuration and redirects to Boot sequence
10. If block event lines persist, run `window.clearBlockAnnotations()` in your
    browser console to remove them. Events now store full timestamps, so
    annotations should disappear once they fall outside the 3‑hour window.

## Easter Egg

Activate the Konami Code (⇡ ⇡ ⇣ ⇣ ◀ ▶ ◀ ▶ b a) on any page to reveal a brief
deep sea surprise complete with random fun facts!

## Debug Logging

Client-side logging can be noisy in production. All `console.log` calls are
wrapped with a simple debug flag. Set `localStorage.setItem('debugLogging',
'true')` in your browser to enable verbose logging. Remove the item or set it to
`false` to silence debug output.
